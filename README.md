# Motor Imagery EEG decoding using TS-SEFFNet
The model code for the TS-SEFFNet proposed in the paper "A Temporal-Spectral-based Squeeze-and-Excitation Feature Fusion Network for Motor Imagery EEG Decoding". 

This is implemented using pytorch framework.

Please download the "scaling_filter.mat" and change the file path in the TS-SEFFNet.py in line 117.
